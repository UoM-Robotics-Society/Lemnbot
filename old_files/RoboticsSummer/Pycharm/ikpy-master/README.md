# Features
With IKPy, you can :

* Compute the **Inverse Kinematics** of every existing robot.
* Define your kinematic chain using **arbitrary representations** : DH (Denavitâ€“Hartenberg), URDF standard, custom...
* Automaticly import a kinematic chain from a **URDF file**.
* IKPy is **precise** (up to 7 digits) : the only limitation being your underlying model's precision, and **fast** : from 7 ms to 50 ms (depending on your precision) for a complete IK computation.
* **Plot** your kinematic chain : no need to use a real robot (or a simulator) to test your algorithms!
* Define your own Inverse Kinematics methods

Moreover, IKPy is a **pure-Python library** : the install is a matter of seconds, and no compiling is required.

# Installation
You have three options :


1. From PyPI (recommended) : Simply run :

   ```bash
   pip install ikpy
   ```

2. If you work with Anaconda, there's also a Conda package of Pypi :
  ```
  conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/phylliade ikpy
  ```

3. From source : First download and extract the archive, then run :

   ```bash
   pip install ./
   ```    
   NB : You must have the proper rights to execute this command

# Quickstart
Follow this IPython [notebook](https://github.com/Phylliade/ikpy/blob/master/tutorials/ikpy/Quickstart.ipynb).


# Guides and Tutorials
Go the the [wiki](https://github.com/Phylliade/ikpy/wiki). It should introduce you to the basics concepts of IKPy.

# API Documentation
An extensive documentation of the API can be found [here](http://ikpy.readthedocs.org).


# Dependencies and compatibility
The library can work with both versions of Python (2.7 and 3.x).
It requires numpy and scipy.

Sympy is highly recommended, for fast hybrid computations, that's why it is installed by default.

Matplotlib is optional : it is used to plot (in 3D) your models.


# Contributing
IKPy is designed to be easily customisable : you can add your own IK methods or robot representations (such as DH-Parameters) using a dedicated [developper API](https://github.com/Phylliade/ikpy/wiki/Contributing).

Contributions are welcome : if you have an awesome patented (but also open-source!) IK method, don't hesitate to propose for adding in the lib!

# Links
* If performance is your main concern, aversive++ has an inverse kinematics [module](https://github.com/AversivePlusPlus/ik) written in C++, which works the same way IKPy does.
